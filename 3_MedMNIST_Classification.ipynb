MedMNIST is designed for performing image classification in various settings (binary/multiclass, ordinal regression, multi-label), supporting numerous research and educational purposes in biomedical image analysis. Similarly to the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, MedMNIST images are resized to 28x28 resolution, though larger variants up to 224x224 are available. More information about the MedMNIST dataset is given under the \"Sources\" above."],"metadata":{"id":"cyYm53QAkaTr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## The Task\n","\n","In this notebook, you will work with the 2D DermaMNIST sub-dataset, which consists of ~10K images of skin lesions (area of your skin that is abnormal from the skin around it), catregorized into 7 classes. The DermaMNIST is based on the HAM10000, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images.

The source images of 3×600×450 are resized into 3×28×28.',\n"," 'url': 'https://zenodo.org/records/10519652/files/dermamnist.npz?download=1',\n"," 'MD5': '0744692d530f8e62ec473284d019b0c7',\n"," 'url_64': 'https://zenodo.org/records/10519652/files/dermamnist_64.npz?download=1',\n"," 'MD5_64': 'b70a2f5635c6199aeaa28c31d7202e1f',\n"," 'url_128': 'https://zenodo.org/records/10519652/files/dermamnist_128.npz?download=1',\n"," 'MD5_128': '2defd784463fa5243564e855ed717de1',\n"," 'url_224': 'https://zenodo.org/records/10519652/files/dermamnist_224.npz?download=1',\n"," 'MD5_224': '8974907d8e169bef5f5b96bc506ae45d',\n"," 'task': 'multi-class',\n"," 'label': {'0': 'actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma',\n","  '1': 'basal cell carcinoma',\n","  '2': 'benign keratosis-like lesions',\n","  '3': 'dermatofibroma',\n","  '4': 'melanoma',\n","  '5': 'melanocytic nevi',\n","  '6': 'vascular lesions'},\n"," 'n_channels': 3,\n"," 'n_samples': {'train': 7007, 'val': 1003, 'test': 2005},\n"," 'license': 'CC BY-NC 4.0'}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We can also observe the unique skin lesion labels as well as the number of channels (3 for RGB):"],"metadata":{"id":"Hf3-fTjpQWFe"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print('Labels:')\n","INFO['dermamnist']['label']"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2BDPpHZUQcBi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743962433031,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Laura Legat","userId":"08447403520972321571"}},"outputId":"dcb538c2-ce6c-4de2-8c80-7b4e1d67f4f5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Labels:\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'0': 'actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma',\n"," '1': 'basal cell carcinoma',\n"," '2': 'benign keratosis-like lesions',\n"," '3': 'dermatofibroma',\n"," '4': 'melanoma',\n"," '5': 'melanocytic nevi',\n"," '6': 'vascular lesions'}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print('Channels:', INFO['dermamnist']['n_channels'])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"JWeH8G7yQvUU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1743962441559,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"Laura Legat","userId":"08447403520972321571"}},"outputId":"c7113b5d-d59a-4b16-a782-b38cb671fd4d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Channels: 3\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## DermaMNIST pre-processing"],"metadata":{"id":"3PDko4WSr1v8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["First, the data is downloaded and split into train-val-test sets in a 70-10-20% fashion.
